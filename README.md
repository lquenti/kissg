KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID STATIC SITE GENERATOR

I got sick fucking around with hugo and next so I just hack together one myself

## wip :)

## Note to myself

SSG design seems really hard. You either make it too opinionated (only blog pages! hard defined routes!) or it gets a big boy scary monolith that noone can hack about.

I think one should rather create a high level "DSL" built on python analagous to NVIDIA's HPCCM. Thus, the next work should probably be a stub API design, maybe even as a pair programming project
