# Why Use PHP?

PHP is a powerful and flexible language that is easy to learn and use. It is widely used for web development and has a large and active community of developers. Some of the key features of PHP include:

- **Server-side scripting:** PHP is a server-side language, which means that it runs on the server and generates HTML that is sent to the client's web browser.

- **Ease of use:** PHP is easy to learn and use, especially for beginners. Its syntax is similar to C and Perl, making it familiar to many developers.

- **Flexibility:** PHP can be used for a wide range of web development tasks, from simple websites to complex web applications.

- **Large community:** PHP has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development and create a wide range of libraries and tools.

# Basic Syntax

Here is a basic example of a PHP script that prints "Hello, World!" to the web page:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<?php
echo "Hello, World!";
?>
</body>
</html>
```

In PHP, code is enclosed in `<?php` and `?>` tags, and the echo statement is used to print text to the web page
